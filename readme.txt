1.Module name
When you create new modules, keep in mind that you must make the name of the module with only one _ . If you use more than one _, you fail to use the moudle you made.


2. Allocate/Deallocate
When you create module, you do not have to use allocate some variables in the module program if you did it in the main program.

If you allocate the variables in the module and main program, It shows this error: Attempting to allocate already allocated variable 'mv_mean_bscan'.
